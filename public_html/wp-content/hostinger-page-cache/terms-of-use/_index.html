<p>How does a &#8216;dispute&#8217; occur in the Marketplace?</p>
<p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
<p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller&#8217;s payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>How is a &#8216;dispute&#8217; created?</p>
<p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to dispute@itshop.com, while the Seller can write to ss@itshop.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.</p>

<p>Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on itshop. However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At itshop, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.</p>
<p>What is a &#8216;dispute&#8217;?</p>
<p>A &#8216;Dispute&#8217; can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Website.</p>
<p>How does a &#8216;dispute&#8217; occur in the Marketplace?</p>
<p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
<p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller&#8217;s payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>How is a &#8216;dispute&#8217; created?</p>
<p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to dispute@itshop.com, while the Seller can write to ss@itshop.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.</p>
<p>What are the various types of &#8216;disputes&#8217;?</p>
<p>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:</p>
<p>Wrong item received</p>
<p>Item Not as described</p>
<p>Damaged or Seal broken on Product<br />
Part/Accessory missing<br />
Item not Compatible<br />
Seller Description/Specification Wrong<br />
Defective (Functional issues)<br />
Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice</p>
<p>In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then itshop will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.</p>
<p>Buyer Protection Program</p>
<p>In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund or a replacement, itshop will actively work towards reaching a resolution.</p>
<p>The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller or are not satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.</p>
